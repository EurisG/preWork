        <p>My name is <strong>Euris Gonzalez</strong>, a Latino raised in the Bronx living with his mother and two younger sisters.<br>
          Fun fact about me is that in high school I was part of my school marching band where I was a drummer.<br>
          During my school years I taught myself how to play instruments like piano and guitar. While getting my associates degree I was introduced to <br>
          programming. I was enrolled in an intro class for web development and was taught simple HMTL and CSS. The class was only an elective<br>
          but I realized early how valuable it was. Fast foward now, I wanted to dive into the tech industry but didn't know where to start.<br>
          After researching for coding programs I came across <em>Per Scholas</em> and felt it was exactly what I was looking for.
